This program takes as input a low-resolution electronic density map
(e.g. from electron microscopy) for a protein and a structure of the
same protein in some other conformation. It then deforms the conformation
to fit into the electronic density while preserving the protein structure
through the use of low-energy normal modes.

Type "density_fit" without arguments to get a short description of how to
use this program.
